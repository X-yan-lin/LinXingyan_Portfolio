- **Description**: Analysis of the impact of COVID-19 school closures on parental labor supply in Uganda.
- **Key Techniques**: Econometric modeling, Difference-in-Differences.
- **Folder**: [Stata_CEGA](/Stata_CEGA)

### R: Malaria Incidence Prediction in Afghanistan
- **Description**: Spatial analysis predicting malaria incidence based on environmental factors.
- **Key Techniques**: Moranâ€™s I statistic, spatial regression models.
- **Folder**: [R MalariaIncidence](/R_MalariaIncidence)


### Python: Clustering Analysis of ESG Ratings
- **Description**: Study of retail investors' decision-making influenced by ESG ratings.
