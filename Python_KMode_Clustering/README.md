# Clustering Analysis of ESG Ratings on Retail Investor Decision-Making

## Project Background
This project was developed to assist the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) and other regulators in understanding how retail investors' attitudes towards Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors influence their investment decisions. 

## Methodology
The experiment involved a discrete choice experiment(DCE) to evaluate the impacts of attributes, like the fund’s investment strategy and the fund’s risk profile, on investor decision-making. As a follow-up, a K-mode clustering was applied to identify how different invesetor profiles respond to fund attributes. 

## About the Files
- Includes scripts for the clustering analysis of investor attitudes, providing insights into how different groups react to ESG information.
