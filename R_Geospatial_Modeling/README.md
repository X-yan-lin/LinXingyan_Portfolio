# Malaria Incidence Prediction in Afghanistan

## Project Background
This project aims to understand and predict the prevalence of Malaria based on geographic characteristics such as average yearly temperature and precipitation.

## Methodology
The dataset includes data from a national malaria indicator assessment conducted in 2008, covering 157 areas. I employed spatial analysis techniques:
- **Moranâ€™s I statistic** to detect clustering of Malaria cases.
- **Spatial regression** using Generalized Linear Model and Generalized Additive Model with a binomial logit link to assess the relationship between Malaria prevalence and environmental variables.

## About the Files
- The file details the statistical methods applied to the geographical data to predict and understand Malaria trends in Afghanistan.
