# Improving Evidence Uptake in Curriculum-Aligned Professional Learning (CAPL)

## Project Background
This initiative supports the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and its partner organizations in understanding the procurement processes for professional learning in K-12 school districts. The project identifies key barriers and drivers affecting the selection and adoption of curriculum-aligned professional learning (CAPL). Insights gained were used to develop and test behavioral science interventions aimed at enhancing evidence uptake among district decision-makers.

## Methodology
- **Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT)**: We conducted RCTs to evaluate behavioral interventions designed to improve evidence uptake among district buyers, such as superintendents and teacher leaders.
- **Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE)**: We utilized DCEs to explore the psychological constructs of trust towards professional learning vendors.

## About the Files
- This repository hosts scripts for implementing the RCT and DCE on oTree, an online platform dedicated to behavioral science experiments. These scripts facilitate the administration of the trials and the collection and analysis of data.
