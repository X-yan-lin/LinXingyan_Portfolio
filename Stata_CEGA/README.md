# Balancing Work and Childcare: Evidence from COVID-19 School Closures in Uganda

## Project Background
This research examines the impact of COVID-19 school closures on parental labor supply in Uganda. We explored how these closures, followed by a partial reopening in October 2020, affected the labor participation of parents with school-aged children.

## Methodology
The analysis utilizes six rounds of World Bank phone survey data. Using Stata, I processed these datasets to create comparable metrics across key variables. The econometric approach involved a Difference-in-Differences research design, incorporating individual and county-by-month fixed effects to isolate the impact of school reopening on parental labor hours.
